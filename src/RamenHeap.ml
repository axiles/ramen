(* FIXME: This has not moved to dessser *)
(* Simple leftist heap.
 * We need a heap that works on universal types (since we will store
 * tuples in there and don't bother monomorphize either BatHeap or
 * any of Pfds.heaps), but we want to provide a custom comparison
 * function.
 * This does not collapse duplicate entries (= entries for which the
 * comparison function returns 0), unlike BatMap.PMap.
 * Smallest elements are nearest to the root.
 * When two elements compare equal the relative order is unspecified. *)
