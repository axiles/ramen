(* Graphite impersonator.
 *
 * Implement (the most important bits of) Graphite API for Grafana.
 * This way, there is no need for a Grafana plugin. Just run
 * `ramen graphite --port=XYZ` and create a graphite datasource in
 * Grafana, and then basic charts of time series should just work.
 *
 * What is supported:
 * - Normal charts;
 * - Autocompletion of time series in chart editor;
 * - The "*" metric;
 * - All dates used by Grafana.
 *
 * Functions are currently not supported and should be disabled.
 * There seems to be a call to get the list of supported functions, maybe
 * investigate that?
