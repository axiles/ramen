== Next Stops

- Improve packaging: do not rely on ocamlfind or even the installed ocaml compiler at runtime, build a debian package;

- Improve GUI. In particular, allows to build dashboards;

- Performance Improvements (requires code generated by LLVM rather than OCaml);

- Proper Storage.

- Ringbuffers over the network;

- Better interconnection stories, esp. for the alerter.

== Annoyances To Be Addressed

- Better monitoring of the nodes;

- Integer overflows;

- Better parse errors;

- Edition syntax-aware tools (such as context-aware suggestions, syntax
  highlighting...  Require more annotations during parsing).
