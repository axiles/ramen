Cannot solve typing constraints: 
     In function [1;32mf0[0m, field [1;34mx[0m: In CASE WHEN true THEN 1 ELSE "glop" END: expression [1;33m1[0m must be of type U32
 AND In function [1;32mf0[0m, field [1;34mx[0m: In CASE WHEN true THEN 1 ELSE "glop" END: expression [1;33m"glop"[0m must be of type STRING
 AND In function [1;32mf0[0m, field [1;34mx[0m: expression [1;33mCASE WHEN true THEN 1 ELSE "glop" END[0m: else clause must have a type compatible with other consequents
 AND In function [1;32mf0[0m, field [1;34mx[0m: expression [1;33mCASE WHEN true THEN 1 ELSE "glop" END[0m: consequent must have a type compatible with others
