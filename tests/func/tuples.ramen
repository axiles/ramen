-- Check we can refer to fields from out defined erlier:
DEFINE f1 AS
  FROM fixtures/n123/csv
  SELECT max n, max_n+1 AS max_n_p1
  COMMIT AFTER sum 1 = 3;

-- We also can do an aggregate function within another one:
DEFINE f2 AS
  FROM fixtures/n123/csv
  SELECT max (1 + max n) as max_np1
  COMMIT AFTER sum 1 = 3;

-- Here max(np1) is not correct because we cannot init a stateful function with
-- member of out tuple, even when declared earlier.  In theory, we'd like init
-- to be able to build the fields of out that it needs (here, to compute
-- in.n+1). This would probably require to have the same function compute the
-- out tuple and the init aggr, field by field, which requires a redesign of the
-- aggregation function. So for now all we want is to detect this case and
-- return an error whenever the argument of a stateful function requires a tuple
-- that is not available to the group_init function (aka all but the in tuple).
-- This is the exact same restriction for the commit/flush clause as their state
-- are initialized and updated at the same time as the select clause states of
-- course.  Notice that we can access inner functions states (so for instance,
-- "max (1 + max)" works).  What we can't access is fields from the out tuple.
