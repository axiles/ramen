-- This is really the simplest program that could be written:
define f1 as yield 1 as one;

-- A bit less simple, with several fields and various scalar data types,
-- as well as an "every" clause:
define f2 as
  yield
    true as a_bool,
    "glop" as a_string,
    1::2 as an_ipv6,
    i24(24) as an_i24,
    i40(40) as an_i40,
    u48(48) as an_u48,
    i56(56) as an_i56,
    string(42) as a_converted_string,
    3.141 as a_float,
    0.718 + 2.000 as another_float,
    if true or false then (#\t; [1;2]) else (#\f; [3;4]) as a_constructed_value
  every 0.5s;
