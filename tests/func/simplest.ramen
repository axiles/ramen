-- vim: ft=sql

-- This is really the simplest program that could be written:
define f1 as yield 1 as one;

-- A bit less simple, with several fields and various scalar data types,
-- as well as an "every" clause:
define f2 as
  yield
    true as a_bool,
    "glop" as a_string,
    1::2 as an_ipv6,
    i24(24) as an_i24,
    u48(48) as an_u48,
    i56(56) as an_i56
  every 0.5s;
