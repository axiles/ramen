-- `DEFINE t1 AS SELECT NULL AS f` would not work because we do not
-- assign arbitrary type to an output field, since it could be used
-- from another function (`DEFINE t2 AS SELECT f+1 FROM t1`). We do
-- assign arbitraty types to lone NULL left in the AST so that we can
-- generate code, but those are garanteed to be unused anyway.
